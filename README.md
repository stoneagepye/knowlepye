for ardunio mega and pzem-0004 
after serching and finding lost of code that did not work for me .
its dfficult to find simple explanation of how it impiment #include <PZEM004Tv30.h> workings
so i hacked some simpler code i found on github
this code is as simple as i could  make.and it worked
the pzem has a default open address,ir you don,t spceify an address
the module uses 0x01 . it can then be given a user address alowing multiple pzem 
thanks to ASMotionLab
